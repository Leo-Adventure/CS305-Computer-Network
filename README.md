### 《计算机网络：自顶向下方法》概念整理

对于《计算机网络：自顶向下方法》的术语概念整理，见本仓库的 PDF，为本人期末复习所整理，希望能够帮助到每一位学习计网的同学~

## Local DNS Server

In  assignment1, we were asked to implement a local DNS server using Python, the task can be devided into four parts, individually query, reply, cache and multi-thread. Now I have implemented to the cache part.

I have written detailed comment in the code.

## Danmuku System

In assignment2, we were required to implement a danmuku system using both websocket and HTTP protocol.

Now the project has finished~

## Routing Simulation
In assignment3, we were required to implemented the routing algorithm(Dijkstra Algorithm) and the routing aggregation algorithm.
In this assignment, I get a proficiency in Python.

## Project: CDN System

In the project, we were required to implemented a CDN System that can adjust the bit rate of a video according to the current bandwidth of the uses.
