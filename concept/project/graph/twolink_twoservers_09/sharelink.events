# This file contains a list of link change events to execute in the simulated
# network. Columns are as follows:
#
# <time> <link> <bandwidth>
#
# time: time (in seconds) after the previous event that this event should run
# 		Floats are ok. The character '*' indicates the event should wait to
#		run until the user presses enter.
#
# link: The link to modify. This must be one of the bottleneck links specified
#       in netsim topology. It must be a string of the format
#       "link_<num>", which should be identical to the link name in netsim topology.
#
# bandwidth: The BW to set. Should be in kbit/s unit
#

# If you want to make other event scripts for testing purposes, make them in separate files
# and use the -e flag on netsim.py (run netsim.py -h for more info).

0 link_1 1000 # start link BW at 1 mbps
20 link_1 500 # after 20 seconds, decrease to 500 kbps
20 link_1 250 # starting at 40 seconds, alternate b/w 250 and 500
5 link_1 500 # starting at 40 seconds, alternate b/w 250 and 500
5 link_1 250 
5 link_1 500 
5 link_1 250
